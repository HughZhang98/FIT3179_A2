      <p><b>In summary</b>, from these data, people have a lot of demand for coffee, and the average coffee drinker has to drink 2 cups of coffee a day per person. And in the IT world, the number of men drinking coffee is not only more than women, but also drink more cups of coffee than women, I think it may be the reason that the number of male programmers, and the pressure of male programmers to be more.</p>
